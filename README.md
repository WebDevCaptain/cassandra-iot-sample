# IOT Data API

A Smart City IoT Data API that registers sensors and ingests time-stamped readings.

## Data Model

### Sensors Table

- Stores the core info needed for each sensor.
- **Fields:**
  - `sensor_id` (PK): Unique id for each sensor
  - `type`: Type of sensor (e.g. air_quality, temperature)
  - `lat` and `lng`: Geographic coordinates of the sensor
  - `description`: description of the sensor
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the sensor was registered. We use `toTimestamp(now())` to get the current timestamp while storing.

### Sensor Readings Table

- **Fields:**

  - `sensor_id`: Id to link the reading to a sensor (kind of FK in RDBMS)
  - `timestamp` (Clustering Key): When the reading was taken. Helps order the data (we use it for querying)
  - `value`: The numeric reading (e.g. air quality value).
  - `unit`: The unit of measurement (e.g PPM)
  - `status`: The status of the reading (e.g. ok, warning).

- **Notes --**
  - **Time-Series Data:** Using `sensor_id` as partition key and `timestamp` as clustering key supports efficient time-range queries.
  - **High Write Throughput:** Designed to handle a large number of writes from sensors.
  - **TTL Support:** Can use Cassandraâ€™s TTL to automatically remove old data. [TODO]

## Why use Cassandra for this IoT system ????

> Compared to Traditional Databases (MySQL/Postgres) and MongoDB

- **High Write Throughput:** Cassandra is designed to handle many writes per second (with very low latency), which is ideal for time-series sensor data. Can easily load balance across multiple nodes in a Cluster...

- **Scalability:** It scales horizontally very easily; new nodes can be added without downtime (Mongo can also do this)

- **Distributed Architecture:** There is no single point of failure. Data is automatically replicated across multiple nodes (No master/slave setup)

- **Tunable Consistency** You can balance between consistency and performance by choosing the right consistency level

- **Time-Series Support:** With its partition and clustering keys, Cassandra naturally supports time-series data models..

- **Built-In TTL ** Easily set expiration times on data, automatically cleaning up old sensor readings (caches like Valkey(Redis), Memcached do this often)
